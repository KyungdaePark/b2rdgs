# 3DGStream

Official repository for the CVPR 2024 paper "3DGStream: On-the-fly Training of 3D Gaussians for Efficient Streaming of Photo-Realistic Free-Viewpoint Videos".

Please refer to [Project Page](https://sjojok.github.io/3dgstream) for more information.

## Tiny 3DGStream Viewer

We have released an open-source [3DGStream Viewer](https://github.com/SJoJoK/3DGStreamViewer) based on a community [3DGS Viewer](https://github.com/limacv/GaussianSplattingViewer).

## Pre-Release Code

We have created a private repository containing an unpolished version of our code as pre-release code, along with a simple guide in README for researchers to use. If you are interested in accessing this repository, please send an email from your affiliated institutional email address to csjk@zju.edu.cn with a brief explanation of your need (e.g., working on a submission for NeurIPS or SIGGRAPH Asia) and your github account (username, full name, and/or email). We will provide you with the link to the repository and access permissions.

Please note that this pre-release is intended for urgent research needs only. If your work is not time-sensitive, we recommend waiting for the code release scheduled for May. The upcoming release will have refinements that are not present in this pre-release, and using the current version might lead to confusion due to mismatches with the improved codebase.
