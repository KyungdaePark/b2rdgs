# 3DGStream

Official repository for the CVPR 2024 paper "3DGStream: On-the-fly Training of 3D Gaussians for Efficient Streaming of Photo-Realistic Free-Viewpoint Videos".

Please refer to [Project Page](https://sjojok.github.io/3dgstream) for more information.

## Tiny 3DGStream Viewer

We will release an open-source [3DGStream Viewer](https://github.com/SJoJoK/3DGStreamViewer) based on a community [3DGS Viewer](https://github.com/limacv/GaussianSplattingViewer) in next few days/hours, which has slightly slower render speed (~160 FPS on NVIDIA RTX 2060, havn't test on 3090 yet) but is highly configurable.

Together with the viewer, we will release some "Free-Viewpoint Videos" of the N3DV dataset constructed by 3DGStream, which can be "watched" by the viewer.
